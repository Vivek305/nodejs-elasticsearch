The bar will be one of the following formats depending on available width: [.. ] downloaded / total downloaded / total [.. ] If total width is unknown or <= 0, the bar will show a bytes counter using two adaptive styles: %s / unknown %s If there is not enough space on the screen, do not display anything. The returned string doesn't include control characters like used to place cursor at the beginning of the line to erase previous content. This function leaves one free character at the end of the string to avoid automatic linefeed on Windows. wget.download('http://url.com', '/save/dir', bar=fe.util.bar_custom) Args: current : The current amount of progress. total : The total amount of progress required by the task. width : The available width. Returns: A formatted string to display the current progress.", "title": "bar_custom"}
